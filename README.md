# Engine

a hot mess of shit, tears, C# and a bunch of chatgpt cuz i keep forgetting what i tell it and then have to ask again what i asked for a minute ago and then ask it to not write code for me cuz then i get sad but then also ask it to write code as a baseline which makes me happy

## weeeee
## Okay how does this thing work?
Gee I wish I could tell you

Okay basically, you'll notice 2 folders called /Engine/ and /Game/ 

The engine fits around the game, the aim is to have /Game/ use API bits from /Engine/ that I make and hopefully I can then make games in le engine

## Engine folders, what do they mean?
You can also look at the "what_is_this.txt" file for each folder too but heres a simple breakdown

Engine - Houses the engine

CONFIG - Some engine config you might wanna use at some point

Core   - Handles game loop and like physics and stuff

Input  - Handles input and that movement

Maths  - Cool maths stuff you can use

Render - Handles rendering eventually

All these mixtures of C# and prayers eventually merge to form /Engine/ to work with /Game/ but wait! What is /Game/?

## OK whats /Game/?
/Game/ is the game folder, automatically shipped with the base engine so you don't have to press 2 buttons (how nice am I?)

Games you make (most likely me though, why would you use my spaghetti code) go into the /Game/ folder and then it kinda just merges with engine and uh, yeah, thats it



## STUFF
Subject to change and whatnot
If you find a problem, cry abt it, make an issue thingy and yeah
> Okay actually don't do that, knowing me there'll be quite a few errors pretty much everywhere
I promised myself I'd finish this cuz it makes me look cool n shit

:D

Oh yeah about the MIT license, do what you want with this engine just gimme creds pls thx
